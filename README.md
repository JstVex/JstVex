### Hello Everyone

I'm a self-taught full stack developer whos currently creating projects using the lastest features of Next.js, Typescript and other cool technologies. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio and my side projects including Curations and Creo
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript, getting in depth into databases, apparently returning back to basic skills such as javascript and improving how to structure my codes and all.
